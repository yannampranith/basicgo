package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var i int = 0
	var f float64 = 0.0
	var b bool = false
	var s string = ""
	fmt.Printf("%v %v %v %q\n", i, f, b, s)
}
This code initializes the variables i, f, b, and s with their respective zero values, similar to the original code. However, it uses the long form variable declaration syntax var name type = value instead of the short form name := value. Both forms are valid in Go, but the short form is usually preferred for brevity and clarity.
